        <h4>About</h2>
        <p>A Biomedical Engineer with a diverse background in clinical engineering, medical coordination, and data science instruction, I am excited to leverage my skills and experience to embark on a career in software engineering.<br>

With a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, obtained in 2014, I have gained valuable experience working in various hospitals in Egypt and Qatar. These roles have allowed me to develop a strong foundation in operation management, clinical engineering, and project planning. During my career, I consistently demonstrated my ability to solve complex problems and provide innovative solutions to improve work flow.<br>

Recognizing the significance of software engineering in healthcare and driven by my passion for technology, I decided to expand my skill set. I pursued an academic diploma in Computer Science from Cairo University, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of software development principles, algorithms, and data structures. Moreover, I obtained a professional diploma in Artificial Intelligence, enabling me to explore the applications of AI and machine learning in healthcare and other industries.<br>

Currently, I am contributing to the field of data science and machine learning as an instructor. This role has allowed me to share my knowledge and expertise with aspiring data scientists and developers, guiding them in leveraging the power of data-driven decision-making and machine learning algorithms. As an instructor, I have honed my communication and mentoring skills, which I believe will be invaluable in collaborating with a team of software engineers.</p>
